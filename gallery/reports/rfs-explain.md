# Random forest survival: explain

# Random forest survival: explain

Explains the forest the `rfs-fit` job in this set saved: which
predictors drive it, and how.

An `rfs-explain` job never grows a forest. It reads `rfs.rds`, which the
fit job writes, and rebuilds the training data and the model from the
forest itself. VIMP, minimal depth and the partial-dependence plots all
describe that saved forest and no other; VarPro grows its own forests on
the same training data, so its panel and partial describe forests VarPro
grew, not the saved one. Each expensive step is cached on its own:
changing how many variables get dependence plots recomputes the partials
and nothing else.

# knits through an intermediate and current_input() returns THAT file, so the

# fires on every render, finished or not. Measured, not theorised -- a probe
# found three markers in a file containing two. A guard that cries wolf on a

## Study choices

Edit these values for this study before rendering. The outcome and
predictors are not here: they come from the forest.

Code

``` r
# Demo: the fit's selection is used; set any of these only to confirm it.
# NULL takes the value the fit job used.
WHERE <- NULL
ID <- NULL
KEY <- NULL

# Demo: how many variables get dependence plots, ranked by VIMP. The partials
# are the expensive step, so keep this small.
TOP_K <- 4

# Demo: or name the variables yourself. NULL takes the top TOP_K by VIMP.
PARTIAL_VARS <- NULL

# Demo: survival horizons for the partial plots, in the units of the fit job's
# time variable. The VarPro partial uses the last one.
TIMES <- c(1, 5, 10)

# Demo: seed for VIMP, VarPro and the partials. It is part of every cache key.
SEED <- 2026

# Set TRUE after changing a choice above. A cache whose inputs changed stops the
# render instead of returning the old result; TRUE recomputes only the caches
# that are out of date.
